  - name: "Do the gateways verify the data they return?"

      The gateways use <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/rainbow" target="_blank">Rainbow</a> to fetch data from IPFS, which means that data is verified before being returned to users.
    
  # faqs item
  - name: "Can I access the gateways in a trustless way?"
    content: "The gateways are provided as a HTTP compatibility layer, and don't currently implement any trustless access methods. That said, if you are interested in exploring this more, we would highly recommend you experiment with Helia, a JS IPFS implementation, to experiment with its support for trustless retrievals."
