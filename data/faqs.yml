  - name: "How do the ipfs.io/dweb.link gateways work?"
    content: |
      The ipfs.io gateway runs <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/rainbow" target="_blank">Rainbow</a>,
      an implementation of the <a href="https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways" target="_blank">IPFS HTTP Gateway API</a>,
      to find, retrieve, and serve data. It listens for requests for IPFS content, retrieves
      that content via IPFS, and makes it available to the requester via HTTP. Read the IPFS docs
      to learn more about <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/ipfs-gateway/" target="_blank">IPFS Gateways</a>
      or other <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/public-utilities/#public-ipfs-gateways" target="_blank">Public IPFS Utilities</a>.     
  - name: "I'm trying to use the gateway but something is not working, who should I talk to?"
    content: |
      The best way to get support is to describe your issue clearly and in sufficient detail on the
      <a href="https://discuss.ipfs.tech/" target="_blank">IPFS Forum</a>.     
  - name: "How are these gateways funded? Who is behind this?"
    content: |
      The ipfs.io/dweb.link public gateways are maintained by Interplanetary Shipyard
      on behalf of the IPFS Foundation. The funds are contributed by a range of donors
      who wish to support digital public infrastructure.

  - name: "What's the relationship between gateways and other IPFS instances?"
    content: |
      Running IPFS directly is more efficient, but not all applications or websites support it today.
      Gateways are an interim solution. Longer term, the IPFS project aims to increase direct support for
      ipfs:// in browsers and applications.
      There will always be a role for gateways, but we anticipate that role will shrink as direct
      IPFS support becomes more prevalent.
  - name: |
      How does the gateway <a href=https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/http/gateway/#trustless-verifiable-retrieval" target="_blank">ensure</a> whether the data they return matches the Content ID (CID) in the request? Can I access the gateways in a trustless way?
    content: |
      The ipfs.io gateway is one of the first that verifies the data against the requested CID before being
      returned to users. We do however recommend that clients implement their own verification as that is a
      foundational part of IPFS. To simplify this, gateways support
      <a href="https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/trustless-gateway/#accept-request-header" target="_blank">trustless content types</a>
      that enable <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/http/gateway/#trustless-verifiable-retrieval" target="_blank">verifiable retrieval</a>.
      This requires an explicit opt-in from the client at the time of the request.
    
      If you are interested in exploring this more, we recommend you experiment with
      <a href="https://helia.io/" target="_blank">Helia</a>, a JS IPFS implementation that supports trustless retrievals.
