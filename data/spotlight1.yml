  An IPFS gateway acts as a bridge between the traditional web protocol (HTTP) and the IPFS protocol.
  It listens for requests for IPFS content, retrieves that content via IPFS, and makes it available via HTTP.
  This allows anyone to access content from public IPFS networks, no matter what web browser they're using.

  The IPFS.io public gateway is provided for free on an as-is basis, and not intended to be part of your
  critical path or production infrastructure. The features it supports are listed at here (https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/public-utilities/#supported-features).
  It is one of several <a href="https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/" target="_blank">public IPFS gateways</a>.
