  When a takedown request for the ipfs.io and/or dweb.link gateway(s) is first received at abuse@ipfs.io, the sender will receive an automated system receipt. Next, someone from the takedown team will vet the request to validate that it is legitimate and should be accepted. Once the validity of the request has been established, it will be submitted for further processing.
  </BR>
  </BR>
  From there, an internal system extracts the relevant information from the request and generates an entry for it in our takedown lists. The list is then published to our gateway nodes, and the content in question will return a 410 status when visited.
  </BR>

  Your browser may have a local cache of the content in question and might not reflect that something has been blocked on the gateways. To avoid browser caching, attempt to view the content using your browser's incognito or private mode. You can also prevent caching issues by using a command-line tool such as Curl or Wget.
